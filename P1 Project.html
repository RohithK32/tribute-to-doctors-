	<h1> Tribute to doctors during second wave </h1>

	<h2 class="classoneh2"> Introduction </h2>

	<p class="classonep"><q class="classoneq">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by
			severe acute
			respiratory syndrome coronavirus two</q>The first known case was identified in
		Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an
		ongoing pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global
		pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
		syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,cough,
		headache,fatigue,
		breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.Symptoms may begin one to
		fourteen days after exposure to the virus.At least a third of people who are infected do not
		develop noticeable symptoms.</p>

	<h2 class="classtwoh2"> Tribute to doctors during covid second wave </h2>

	<p class="classtwop">
		<q> <b>National Doctor's Day is celebrated across India on July 1 to mark the birth anniversary, which is
				incidentally also the death anniversary.This year the occasion becomes more significant, considering how
				the medical
				fraternity has been working day and night tirelessly during the Covid-19 pandemic.</b></q>
		In the absence of proper medical facilities and infrastructure during the second wave of the
		deadly virus, doctors were indeed on the frontline battling all odds, risking their own lives,
		working in never-ending shifts, dealing with the crumbling health sector, facing physical
		assaults, dealing with emotional pressures, fear of contracting the virus to their families, to say
		the least. However, despite the challenges, the medicos never stopped rendering their services
		to humanity when the country needed them the most. Be it professional or personal, it has been
		quite a problematic experience for the last one and a half years.
		Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are
		particularly
		vulnerable to the highly infectious disease.In response to the global pandemic, the
		under-resourced doctors are facing unprecedented challenges.The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes
		doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators.
		In the fight against coronavirus, the brave medical army stands strong with thermometers, stethoscopes, and
		ventilators as their weapons.
	</p>


	<p class="classthreep"> Not to forget,
		medical researchers are working day in and night out against all odds, hoping to find the
		antidote to the disease.Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the
		gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the
		way.

		Among the several lessons this coronavirus pandemic has been teaching us, the biggest one is to find
		ways to sufficiently invest in the better and more efficient
		medical fraternity and give medical professionals the respect, compensation and infrastructure that they truly
		deserve once this crisis is over. Moreover, the world needs to work towards advancement in medical research and
		technology. <i>Nothing will be a greater tribute to the
			health-care workers than this.That being said, we'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some
			courageous
			and inspiring doctors from across the globe who lost their lives while saving the lives of COVID-19
			patients.</i>

	<h2 class="classthreeh2"> Devastating covid second wave </h2>

	<p class="classfourp"> <q class="classtwoq">The second wave of COVID-19 in India has had severe consequences in the
			form of spiralling
			cases, reduced supplies of essential treatments, and increased deaths particularly in the young
			population</q>.Understanding why the second wave has been more dangerous than the first could
		help to identify the potential areas of diagnostics to target with future control strategies.
		Studies have identified various circulating double-mutant and triple-mutant strains of
		SARS-CoV-2 across different regions of India, which are more pathogenic than the initial strains.
		Such altered transmissibility and pathogenicity indicates evolution of the virus. The larger the
		population density, the higher are the chances of viral replication, mutation, and evolution, as
		suggested by Moya and colleagues.<q class="classthreeq"> <em> During the second wave in India, many cases of
				mucormycosis, also known as
				the
				black fungus,</em> have been reported in patients with diabetes and patients with COVID-19, as well as
			patients who were recovering from infection.</q></p>

	<img src="doctors01.jpg" height="320" , width="440">

	<p class="classfivep"> During the second wave of COVID-19, the healthcare infrastructure in India has notably faced
		many challenges. Shortage of oxygen cylinders, non-availability of ICU's and beds, absence of
		medicines and crucial drugs like Remdesivir lead many doctors to break down while treating
		patients with severe symptoms.Amid the COVID crisis, numerous cases of doctors being blamed for failing to save
		the lives of
		severe patients have emerged, which has lead to violence in the form of assaults and threats
		against them. Last month, a doctor on COVID-19 duty in Assam was thrashed by the patient's
		relatives who succumbed to Covid 19.7
		The reason why the younger population is now more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 is not apparent
		and beyond current scientific explanations. However, an important observation as the situation
		develops is that every individual appeared to have equal risk of being infected with the virus, but
		the ability to sustain and overcome infection was variable among individuals.</p>

	<h2 class="classfourh2"> second wave covid cases </h2>


	<p class="classsixp"> changes rapidly and may differ by location
		This data changes rapidly and might not reflect some cases still being reported. Some areas may not have data
		because they haven’t published their data or haven’t done so recently. Because data availability differs by
		location, date ranges for 14-day data may start on different dates.
		Total counts include both confirmed and probable cases in some locations. Probable cases are identified by
		public health officials and use criteria developed by government authorities.
		The number of positive tests may not be equal to the number of positive cases because of reporting differences
		across locations. It's also common for a single person to take more than one test. This data uses reporting from
		polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antigen tests.
	</p>

	<img src="secondwave.png" height="320" , width="440">

	<p class="classsevenp"> The rise in case numbers has been exponential in the second wave.On 18 June last year,
		India recorded 11,000 cases and in the next 60 days, it added 35,000 new cases on average
		every day. On 10 February, at the start of the second wave, India confirmed 11,000 cases - and in the
		next 50 days, the daily average was around 22,000 cases.But in the following 10 days, cases rose sharply with
		the daily average reaching 89,800.Experts say this rapid increase shows that the second wave is spreading much
		faster across the country. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part
		of Kerala state's Covid taskforce, said the rise was not entirely unexpected given that India let its guard down
		when daily infections in January fell to fewer than 20,000 from a peak of over 90,000 in September.Undercounting
		of total cases and death figures was reported during the first wave in 2020.There have been large gaps noted
		between official death figures and the sudden increase in the number
		of bodies being cremated and buried. Several crematoria that had been in disuse earlier were brought back into
		operation to keep up with the demand.</p>

	<img src="CASEDATA.png" height="320" , width="440">


	<p class="classeightp">A series of articles in The Hindu newspaper estimated that compared to previous years, the
		number of additional
		deaths during the pandemic (known as the 'excess mortality') was about four times the official COVID death toll
		in Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, and could be up to ten times higher in the state of Gujarat. However, it is not
		clear what proportion of these are due to covid and what are due to other factors such as overcrowding of
		medical facilities, lock-down, etc.A report by the Center for Global Development stated that the second
		wave of COVID-19 in India was the "worst tragedy since the partition". The report, based on serosurveys,
		household data and official data, pointed towards a significant underreporting of deaths, with estimates ranging
		from about 1 million to 6 million deaths overall, with central estimates varying between 3.4 and 4.9 million
		deaths.The next day Ahmedabad counted only 25 deaths. Similar disparities in numbers were seen on other
		days. The Gujarat government denied the under-counting and stated that they were following federal
		protocols.A study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, and units of Harvard University,
		estimated in August 2021 that more than 16,000 excess deaths had occurred in 54 municipalities in Gujarat
		between March 2020
		and April 2021.

	<h3> covid-19 new cases and deaths(India)</h3>

	<p class="classninep"> The study used data from civil death registers in a subset of Gujarat's 162 municipalities.
		The
		authors stated that the "vast majority" of these deaths could likely be attributed directly to Covid-19. The
		government's estimate of the death toll from Covid-19 for the entire state was approximately 10,000 for the same
		period.Till now india has total cases and deaths are 3,30,27,621 and 38,948.During the second wave in the middle
		of march the cases are increased by twice of first wave.
		new cases and deaths occurred in second wave till now cases and deaths are 4,40,752 and 20,450 in india.
	</p>


	<h3> worldwide cases and deaths(who)</h3>

	<div> The discrepancies were detected by comparing official death counts released by the governments to the number
		of
		deaths reported in obituaries, at
		crematoria and burial grounds, etc. Some states were reported to have not added suspected cases to the final
		count contrary to WHO guidelines. Similar undercounting was reported during the second wave in
		2021. Globally,as of 6:16pm CEST, 3 September 2021, there have been 218,946,836 confirmed cases of COVID-19,
		including 4,539,723 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 1 September 2021, a total of 5,289,724,918 vaccine doses have
		been administered.</div>
